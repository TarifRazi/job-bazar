                    What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where
                    should we store them on the client-side?
                </h1>

                <p className="text-justify">
                    Access tokens and refresh tokens are two crucial components of OAuth
                    2.0, an authorization framework that enables applications to access
                    resources on behalf of users without requiring them to share their
                    credentials directly. Let's delve into their roles and how they work
                    together to enhance security and user experience. <br />

                    **Access Tokens: Short-Lived Authorization Keys** <br />

                    An access token is a string of characters that grants a client
                    application permission to access specific resources on a server. It
                    serves as a temporary authorization key, typically valid for a short
                    duration, ranging from a few minutes to several hours. This short
                    lifespan is a security measure to minimize the impact of a
                    compromised token. <br />

                    **Refresh Tokens: Renewing Access without Re-authentication** <br />

                    To overcome the limitations of short-lived access tokens, refresh
                    tokens come into play. A refresh token is another string of
                    characters, typically longer-lived than an access token, that allows a
                    client application to obtain a new access token without requiring the
                    user to reauthenticate. This eliminates the need for frequent logins
                    and enhances user convenience. <br />

                    **Client-Side Storage: Balancing Security and Convenience** <br />

                    Storing access tokens and refresh tokens on the client-side, such as
                    in local storage or cookies, can simplify user experience by avoiding
                    repeated logins. However, this approach raises security concerns, as
                    compromised client-side storage could expose sensitive tokens.

                    **Secure Storage Strategies for Access Tokens**

                    * HTTP-only Cookies with SameSite: Store access tokens in HTTP-only
                    cookies with the SameSite attribute set to Lax or Strict. This
                    restricts transmission to same-origin requests, reducing CSRF
                    attacks.

                    * HTTPS-only Cookies: For enhanced security, store access tokens in
                    HTTPS-only cookies, ensuring transmission only over secure HTTPS
                    connections.

                    **Secure Storage Strategies for Refresh Tokens**

                    * HTTP-only Cookies with Strict SameSite: Store refresh tokens in
                    HTTP-only cookies with the SameSite attribute set to Strict. This
                    further limits transmission to same-origin requests and HTTPS
                    connections.

                    * Secure HTTP-only Cookies: Enable the Secure flag on HTTP-only
                    cookies storing refresh tokens, preventing transmission over
                    non-HTTPS connections.

                    Remember, security should always take priority. If the application
                    handles sensitive data, consider alternative storage methods, such as
                    server-side storage or secure client-side storage libraries.

                    **1. Working Together: Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens in Action**

                    * User Authentication: The user provides credentials to the
                    authorization server, which verifies the user's identity and
                    generates an access token and a refresh token.

                    * Resource Access: The client application sends the access token to
                    the resource server to access protected resources.

                    * Access Token Expiration: Upon access token expiration, the client
                    application sends the refresh token to the authorization server.

                    * Access Token Renewal: The authorization server validates the
                    refresh token and issues a new access token, allowing the client
                    application to continue accessing resources.

                    **Conclusion**

                    Access tokens and refresh tokens play a vital role in OAuth 2.0,
                    enabling secure and convenient user authentication and resource
                    access. By understanding their functions and implementing secure
                    storage practices, developers can build robust and secure web
                    applications.

                    Express.js and Nest JS are both popular Node.js frameworks for
                    building web applications. However, they have different strengths and
                    weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of projects.

                    **Express.js**

                    Express.js is a lightweight and minimal web application framework for
                    Node.js. It is known for its ease of use, flexibility, and large
                    community. Express.js is a good choice for small to medium-sized
                    projects that require a simple and straightforward framework.

                    **Key features of Express.js:**
